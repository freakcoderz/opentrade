OpenTrade developers take security very seriously.  As such, we'd
like to know when a security bug is found so that it can be fixed and
disclosed as quickly as possible.  Please report security bugs to our team.

1) Contact

The OpenTrade team can be contacted by email at ivanivanovkzv@gmail.com.  
As it is with any bug, the more information provided the easier it
will be to diagnose and fix. Any exploit code is very helpful and will not be released without
consent from the reporter unless it has already been made public.

2) Disclosure

The goal of the OpenTrade team is to work with the
bug submitter to bug resolution as well as disclosure.  We prefer
to fully disclose the bug as soon as possible.  It is reasonable to
delay disclosure when the bug or the fix is not yet fully understood,
the solution is not well-tested or for vendor coordination.  However, we
expect these delays to be short, measurable in days, not weeks or months.
A disclosure date is negotiated by the security team working with the
bug submitter as well as vendors.  However, the OpenTrade team
holds the final say when setting a disclosure date.  The timeframe for
disclosure is from immediate (esp. if it's already publicly known)
to a few weeks.  As a basic default policy, we expect report date to
disclosure date to be on the order of 7 days.

3) Non-disclosure agreements

The OpenTrade team is not a formal body and therefore unable
to enter any non-disclosure agreements.
